Around November 2020 Apple published a Metal sample: [Rendering a Scene with Deferred Lighting in C++](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/rendering_a_scene_with_deferred_lighting_in_c).
The sample code included a non-trivial (~4500 CLOC) C++ wrapper library
for the Metal API. This repository is that library extracted from the
other sample code.
